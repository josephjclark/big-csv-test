what i want to do is write the minimum set of data to a smaller file. I want to map each to a unique id

All result data should have a total of 300

we can try and optimise to get just this file working, but we're dighting the inevitable. Eventually we'll hit a file we can't handle.

interesting use-cases:

- i want to have a common getExternalId function used by two jobs
